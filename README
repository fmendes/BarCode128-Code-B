

The application creates a barcode image on the fly, stores it in images 
folder and links it in the webpage. Any older images from the user will be 
deleted before generating a new one.

The barcode is encoded in Code128/code B. I used the specs from 
http://www.adams1.com/128code.html

I had to reduce the width of the bar code for the machine to be able to read
and identify it properly. 

The barcode directory must be granted write access to whathever IUSR account is 
used for anonymous and the ASPNET account too.
